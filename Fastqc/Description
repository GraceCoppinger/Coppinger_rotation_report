#Description of fastqc and example scripts
# First you need to install software in a conda enviorment:
# To install conda: 
wget https://repo.anaconda.com/archive/Anaconda3-latest-Linux-x86_64.sh
bash Anaconda3-latest-Linux-x86_64.sh
# You might need to restart the shell after installing conda

# Create a conda enviorment:
conda create -n tick
conda activate tick
conda deactivate 

#Install necessary software for fastqc:
conda activate tick
conda install bioconda::fastqc

#Lets make a list of all our samples:
nano list
#This command creaes a text file which you can write your commands in
Sample_1
Sample_2
Sample_3
Sample_4
#We can call on this list in future for loops

# Now it is time to make the bash script
nano NAME_OF_SCRIPT.sh

#Lets write our script!
#!/bin/bash
cd PATH/TO/YOUR/RAW/DATA || exit 1
for i in $(cat PATH/TO/YOUR/LIST); do fastqc "${i}.fastq.gz" -t 4; done
#The command ${i} will call on each line (sample id) in your list file you created
#The parameter -t 4 represents the number of cores to use (in this case 4 is pretty standard)


#Example my script I ran
#!/bin/bash
cd /mnt/pathogen2/gcoppinger/00_raw_data_pool || exit 1
for i in $(cat /mnt/pathogen2/gcoppinger/ticklist); do fastqc "${i}.fastq.gz" -t 4; done

# FastQC Script End #

#How to run from the command line
./fastqc.sh

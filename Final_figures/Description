For simplicity I put all the final figures in a power point titled "Jacco_rotation_report"

For reporting the following figures are as follows:
# Quality analysis
- Trimming report
- HiSAT2 Alignment
- FeatureCounts summary files (include arcadia and Amanda .gff anaylsis)

# Bar charts and Pie charts
- Pie chart ~ Showcases the content within the transcriptome
- rRNA Bar chart ~ Of the rRNA contnent (90%) what type of rRNA is the highest
- Scaffold Bar chart ~ Which scaffolds contribute to the highest read counts

# IGV image
- Where does the scaffold with the highest read align to the genome.
